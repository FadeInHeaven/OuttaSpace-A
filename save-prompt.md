# Manual Save Prompt for Gemini

You are assisting in maintaining `memory.md` as an external memory log for this PWA project.

## Instructions
1. Read the current `memory.md` to understand what is already documented.
2. Review the source code and project files in this workspace.
3. Compare the current project state with the most recent entries in `memory.md`.
4. Append a **new Journal entry** in `memory.md` with the heading:

### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Manual Save

5. In this entry, describe:
   - What was changed in the code since the last entry.
   - Why those changes were likely made (if possible).
   - Any new tasks that should be tracked.
   - Any completed tasks to mark as done.

6. Do not erase old entries. Always append at the bottom of the Journal.

Keep the tone concise and factual, like developer notes.
