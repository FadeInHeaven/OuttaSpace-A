# Project Memory for Gemini

> ðŸ“Œ **Instruction to Gemini:**  
> This file serves as your external memory across coding sessions.  
> - At the **start of each session**, read this file to catch up on project history and current tasks.  
> - During the session, use this file to recall decisions and context.  
> - At the **end of each session**, append a new journal entry with:  
>   - A timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format)  
>   - A short summary of what you did or suggested  
>   - Any reasoning or tradeoffs you considered  
>   - Updates to the task list (mark completed tasks, add new ones)  
> - Keep the tone concise and factual.  
> - Do **not** erase old entries â€” always append.  
> 
> This file acts as your **persistent memory**. Treat it as your running logbook.
